# CarND-Controls-MPC
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program

---
The project illustrates the implementation of Model Predictive Control (MPC) controller that enables a car to follow a trajectory provided by path planning module.

This MPC was tunned to achieve a more aggressive driving style. The car in this demo reaches speeds of 90mph and slows down quickly to as low as 30mph. The performance of MPC is comparable to a competitve human driver. All of the decision regarding steering angle and the optimal speed are made by MPC based on a simple kinematic model of a car. The model can be further improved by incorporating more data related to proximity to sounding obstacles as well as by extending the model to incorporate a dynamic model of the vehicle.

## Rubric / Project Specification

### The Model
The model used in the project is a global kinematic model of a vehicle.
**States** - The model assumes that a vehicle state represented by 4 coordinates [x,y, rotation(psi). velocity(v)]
**Actuators** - The state of a vehicle depends only on control inputs of actuators [steering(d), acceleration(a)]
**Update equations** - The control inputs change the state of the car as follows:

x(t+1) = x(t) + cos(psi)*dt

y(t+1) = y(t) + sin(psi)*dt

psi(t+1) = psi(t) + v(t)/Lf * d * dt

v(t+1) = v(t) + a(t)*dt

To find appropriate controller (actuator) values, MPC minimizes a cost function wrt constraints. The const function defined as:

âˆ‘G(d,a,x) = w_cte * cte(t+1) + w_epsi * epsi(t+1) + w_psi * (psi(t+1)-psi(t)) + w_d * d(t) + w_tv * (100mph - v(t+1))

Where:

cte - defined as a cross track error of position y(t+1) and trajectory value f(x(t+1))

epsi - defined as orientation error and being calculated as: epsi = atan( f'(x(t+1)) ) - psi(t+1). Where f'( x(t+1) ) is a derivative of trajectory curve


The corresponding code can be found in **MPC.cpp - lines 78 to 113**.

### Timestep Length and Elapsed Duration (N & dt)

MPC is highly sensitive to the settings of various components of cost function as well as dt and N.
**dt** - the duration of the time stamp was set at 0.1 seconds to run efficiently with the goal to cover a trajectory of roughly 1 second.
N - the number of steps is the main driver of the computational cost associated with the algorithm. Therefore, the N was set based on the length of projected trajectory. The best behavior was achieved using 10 steps.

### Data preprocessing steps

x,y, and psi observations were preprocessed with the inverse of homogenious transform to convert observations from a map coordinate system into a car coordinate system. Velocity value was converted from mph to meters per second.
The overall trajectory was calculated by fitting 3rd-degree polynomial function onto waypoints (transformed into car coordinate system) provided by a simulator/path planning block.


The corresponding code can be found in main.cpp, lines 107-117.


### Model Predictive Control that handles a 100-millisecond latency

In order to adjust for latency in engaging the actuators, the model calculates the new state at the time t+100 milliseconds. The values of the new state are used subsequently to transform coordinates of waypoints. This setup allows controlling the car successfully at various latencies in a range between 0 and 100 milliseconds.


The corresponding code can be found in main.cpp, lines 98-107.
